= Spring REST Docs using REST Assured and Test Containers

== Intro

Testing and Documentation are very important to developing applications that can scale across a team.  In the past with unit tests and
manual documentation, this make made apps harder to manage. Now with technologies like Test Containers, and Spring RestDocs(using Rest Assured)
Doing Integration level tests that really test the API level of your application and provide documentation.

Test Containers give you the ability to use read databases build from docker container instance from your applications tests.

Spring Rest Docs, provides documentation through tests. So instead of having a bunch of annotations, you write integration tests that
actually hit the controller actions using the Rest Assured Http client. The documentation is generated using AsciiDoctor and request and
response signpost generated from Rest Assured, via filters. Another benefit to Spring Rest Docs, is if you add or delete a parater from
the documented request/responce, and you don't update it in your integration tests, your tests will fail. This forces you not only to
maintain your Integration tests better but also your documentation.

== Running the app and tests
RunConfigs are included in the runConfigs folder. To uses them, create a new runconfig and click the `Store as project file` make sure
it points to the `runconfigs` folder, and then you should have access to run those configs.
